# Performance Analysis of Task Scheduling Algorithms in Cloud Computing

This project evaluates the performance of various task scheduling algorithms in a cloud computing environment. Task scheduling is crucial for optimizing resource allocation, minimizing delays, and improving the overall efficiency of cloud-based services.

## Project Overview

Cloud computing enables the on-demand availability of computing resources, such as data storage and processing power, without requiring direct management by users. Task scheduling plays a vital role in ensuring that these resources are used efficiently by assigning tasks to the most suitable resources for execution.

### Key Features
- **Task Scheduling Algorithms:** Implementation and comparison of FCFS, SJF, and Priority Scheduling algorithms.
- **Machine Learning Algorithm:** Here we have used random forest, decision tree and linear regression.
- **Performance Metrics:** Analysis of delay times (input, output, processing) and overall execution time.
- **Algorithm Efficiency:** SJF provides the lowest delay time per process, FCFS the highest, and Priority Scheduling excels when priorities are correctly assigned.
